# halfsubtractor-fullsubtractor
A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs the subtraction of three bits. It consists of three inputs and two outputs. The half subtractor works opposite to the half adder as it subtracts two single bits and results in a difference bit and borrow bit as an output.
